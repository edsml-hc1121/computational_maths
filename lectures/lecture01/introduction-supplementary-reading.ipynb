Because the **results of a simulation are only as good as the underlying model(s), engineers, operators, and analysts must pay particular attention to its construction**.

The 2006 National Science Foundation (NSF) Report on \"Simulation-based Engineering Science\" showed the potential of using simulation technology and methods to revolutionize the engineering science. Among the reasons for the steadily increasing interest in simulation applications are the following:\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using simulations is generally **cheaper, safer and sometimes more ethical** than conducting real-world experiments.

Similar efforts are conducted to simulate hurricanes and other natural catastrophes.\n",

Examples are supporting deep water operation of the US Navy or the simulating the surface of neighbored planets in preparation of NASA missions.\n",
    "<br>\n",

    "3. Simulations **can often be conducted faster than real time**. This allows using them for efficient if-then-else analyses of different alternatives, in particular when the necessary **data** to initialize the simulation can easily be obtained from operational data. This use of simulation adds **decision support** simulation systems to the tool box of traditional decision support systems.\n",

Simulations allow **setting up a coherent synthetic environment** that allows for integration of simulated systems in the early analysis phase via mixed virtual systems with first prototypical components to a virtual test environment for the final system. If managed correctly, the environment can be migrated from the development and test domain to the training and education domain in follow-on life cycle phases for the systems (including the option to train and optimize a virtual twin of the real system under realistic constraints even before first components are being built).\"\n",

    "\"A surrogate model is an engineering method used when an outcome of interest cannot be easily directly measured, so a model of the outcome is used instead. Most engineering design problems require experiments and/or simulations to evaluate design objective and constraint functions as a function of design variables. For example, in order to find the optimal airfoil shape for an aircraft wing, an engineer simulates the airflow around the wing for different shape variables (length, curvature, material, ..). **For many real-world problems, however, a single simulation can take many minutes, hours, or even days to complete. As a result, routine tasks such as design optimization, design space exploration, sensitivity analysis and what-if analysis become impossible since they require thousands or even millions of simulation evaluations**.\n",

    "One way of alleviating this burden is by constructing approximation models, known as surrogate models ... that mimic the behavior of the simulation model as closely as possible while being computationally cheap(er) to evaluate. **Surrogate models are constructed using a data-driven, bottom-up approach. The exact, inner working of the simulation code is not assumed to be known (or even understood), solely the input-output behavior is important**. A model is constructed based on modeling the response of the simulator to a limited number of intelligently chosen data points. ...

Indeed, many computational science competencies translate directly to the analysis of massive data sets at scale with high-end computing infrastructure. As complementary interdisciplinary endeavors, both data science and computational science suffer from the entrapments created by disciplinary boundaries.

The synergy between data science and computational science makes it clear that educational programs in areas like “computational and data science” or “mathematics of data and computation” hold significant promise for interdisciplinary success.\"\n"

In data science, **we do not aim to understand the system, even if we are able to make predictions** from the data that the system generates. The question is, is this needed?

As such, Data Science based predictions work only if the future is fundamentally like the past, and even this is the case then only valid within range. Typically, many systems in which behavior plays a role contain tipping points and regime changes in which the dynamics that generate the data fundamentally change as well. We call these system complex systems in which the complexity lies in the inability to predict future states of the system based on knowledge of its current state.\"\n",
